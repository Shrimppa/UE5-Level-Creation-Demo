# Overview

I made a game with an imported character model, and created a game environment / level in unreal engine 5.1.

I made this because I wanted to learn more about how to work in Unreal Engine, and figure out what is possible.

The project files were too big to add to github so it's just this file.

# Development Environment

I used Unreal Engine 5.1 to develop this project.

I used the blueprint programming of UE5.

# Useful Websites

* [UE5.1 Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/)

# Future Work

* Create gameplay code.
* Incorporate more animations.
* Add a user interface.
